# interactionviz

## ⚠️ _this is still a work in progress_

A no-nonsense, pure Python, renderer and loader for the INTERACTION dataset.

### Quickstart
If you have a recent pip, and Python > 3.7.5, then you can dive straight in with
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/rosshemsley/interactionviz
```
Probably it's best to run this inside of an activated `virtualenv` of some kind.

To view one of the scenes,
```
$ interactionviz --root-dir </root/of/interaction/dataset>
```
